# Cascaded shadow mapping

CSM demo that renders three shadowmaps (directional light) for different areas. More precise shadowmaps are closer to the camera and less accurate shadowmaps are used further from the camera where the details are not so important.

Red, green and blue highlights are used for debug / demo purposes to show where the shadowmap edges are. At those edges the shadow quality should also change.
